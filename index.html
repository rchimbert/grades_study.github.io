								<h2>Project overview</h2>								
								This end-to-end project consists in cleaning and analyse some data from a kaggle dataset (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/alcohol-effects-on-study">The dataset</a>). 
								In this data project, I <b>conducted an analysis </b>of a dataset containing information about 395 students' grades in three Portuguese and math tests. The dataset included various student attributes, such as school type, gender, age, address, family size, parental education, parental occupation, reasons for schooling, guardian information, travel time to school, study time, the number of failures, and other personal factors.
								I used <b>Python and the Pandas library </b>to manipulate and analyze the dataset. During the analysis, I <b>explored the relationships between these student attributes</b> and their performance in math and Portuguese tests (G1, G2, and G3 grades). Based on my analysis, I identified <b>several significant correlations and trends </b>that affected student performance in these subjects.
								My project provides valuable insights into the factors that positively or negatively influence student grades in math and Portuguese. These insights can be used to make informed decisions and recommendations to improve student performance in these subjects.
								This study is detailed on this commented code 
								available on my Github: <a href="https://github.com/rchimbert/Grades-study-impact/blob/main/grade_study_python.ipynb">The code</a>.</p>
